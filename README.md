## Synopsis
A **high-level** language is any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.

A high-level language has a higher level of abstraction from the computer, and focuses more on the programming logic rather than the underlying hardware components such as memory addressing and register utilization.

## Description
At **ALX Holberton School**, we learn by doing. We have projects everyday that we have to push on GitHub in order for an automatic review to be done. This repository contains directories each corresponding to a high-level language project. These projects are part of the ALX Holberton School 1 year curriculum. In these projects, we cover everything from the basics of `Python` and `Javascript` (`Node`), as well as `SQL` (with `MySQL`) to more advanced topics.
