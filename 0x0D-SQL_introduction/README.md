## Synopsis (SQL Overview)
`SQL` is *Structured Query Language*, which is a computer language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data stored in a relational database.

> SQL is a language to operate databases; it includes database creation, deletion, fetching rows, modifying rows, etc. `SQL` is an **ANSI** (American National Standards Institute) standard language, but there are many different versions of the SQL language.

This is an ALX Holberton School project and we are tasked with familiarizing ourselves with storing, manipulating and retrieving of data using SQL.
